This is the React frontend for GetHappyNYC, a user driven happy hour finder for New York City. This is my final project for the Flatiron School, completed at the end of the software engineering program. It is built with React, Redux, and Rails.

The backend, built in Rails, can be found here: https://github.com/ndean87/happy-hour-backend.
